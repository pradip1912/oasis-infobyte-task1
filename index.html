            <h1>LIKE NATURE <br><span>BE CREATIVE!</span> </h1>
            <p class="par">We are living in challenging times and urgently need new ideas for systems and solutions to overcome the current crisis – from climate change to pandemics. It is therefore not surprising that creativity is regarded as one of the most important future skills. Creativity has many flavours — artistic or professional — and each has its specifics. Regardless of the type, creativity involves the active use of imagination and developing original ideas to create something new. Fortunately creativity is the natural order of life and part of being human. Everybody is creative, but some seem to be able to activate their innate creativity better than others.</p>
